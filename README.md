## 🧠 Financial Modelling Methodology

### Assumptions Framework
- Corporate tax rate: 9% (UAE)  
- Inflation: 2.5%  
- Projection period: 5 years  
- Funding approach: Internal accruals  

Assumptions are clearly separated from formulas to ensure transparency and auditability.

---

### Revenue Model
Revenue projections are based on:
- Premium-focused product mix  
- Gradual market penetration  
- Higher-than-global-average growth in initial years  

The revenue mix is skewed toward **Luxe and Dermatological Beauty segments**, reflecting Dubai’s premium consumption profile.

---

### Cost & EBITDA Model
The cost structure incorporates:
- COGS aligned with global premium benchmarks  
- Front-loaded marketing expenditure during initial market entry  
- Stable SG&A as a percentage of revenue  

EBITDA margins are projected to improve gradually and converge toward **L’Oréal’s global operating margin (~20%)**.

---

### Capital Expenditure Model
Capital expenditure is assumed at approximately **3.8% of revenue**, consistent with L’Oréal’s historical reinvestment rate.  
Capex primarily relates to:
- Retail fit-outs  
- IT and digital infrastructure  
- Distribution and logistics support  

Depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method.

---

### Working Capital Model
Working capital assumptions reflect efficient supply chain management:
- Receivables: ~45 days  
- Inventory: ~65 days  
- Payables: ~60 days  

Net working capital remains stable as a percentage of revenue across the forecast period.

---

## 📑 Pro-Forma Financial Statements
The model produces integrated five-year pro-forma statements including:
- Income Statement  
- Cash Flow Statement  
- Supporting schedules  

**Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)** is derived from operating profit after tax, adjusted for depreciation, capital expenditure, and changes in working capital.

---

## 💰 Valuation & Capital Budgeting
Valuation is conducted using a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** approach:
- Cash flow metric: FCFF  
- Discount rate: WACC reflecting strong brand equity and low business risk  
- Terminal growth rate aligned with long-term regional growth  

The valuation indicates a **positive Net Present Value (NPV)**, supporting the financial attractiveness of the Dubai market entry.

---

## 🔍 Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis tests the robustness of valuation against changes in:
- Revenue growth rates  
- EBITDA margins  
- Discount rate (WACC)  

Results indicate that the project remains value-accretive under conservative downside scenarios.

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Limitations
Key risks identified include:
- Competitive intensity in the Dubai market  
- Demand sensitivity to tourism and macroeconomic conditions  
- Regulatory and compliance changes  
- Forecasting limitations inherent in long-term projections  

Mitigating factors include strong brand equity, diversified channels, and conservative modelling assumptions.
